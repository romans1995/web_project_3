                    <p class="places__paragraph-p">Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on the shores of the Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their right mind would swim in the river, unless they grew up here, in which case they've probably tried it at some
                        point. Summers are hot here, and the winters are drafty, but the fall and the spring are are absolutely amazing.</p>
                    <p class="places__paragraph-p">The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet architecture, all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the landscape is difficult to traverse for people on bikes and those
                        wearing heels. The left bank is considered far less interesting and prestigious though, even by people who live on the far outskirts of the right one.</p>

                        on the Shores of Snowdonia has become a popular tourist destination during the summer months.</p>
                    <p class="places__paragraph-p">A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the world's best ice cream at Cadwalader's, whose secret ingredient is rumored to be locally sourced seaweed. Another claim to fame is the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in
                        Bloom award for five years in a row for its spectacular floral displays around town. It was also home to David Lloyd George, the only Welshman ever to hold the office of Prime Minister of the UK.</p>

                    <p class="places__paragraph-p">Berea is a small town located in the central part of Kentucky. The town is surrounded by beautiful forests and countryside. It's known as the arts and crafts capital of the state, and visitors will find plenty of shopping opportunities:
                        shops with handmade jewelry, candles, wood items, galleries, glass studios, and more. The town holds an annual festival celebrating "spoonbread", a local dish made with cornbread and served with a wooden spoon.</p>
                    <p class="places__paragraph-p">However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea College was founded in 1855 and was the first college in the south to be racially integrated, as well as the first to be coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no
                        tuition — every student receives a full-tuition scholarship. </p>

                    <p class="places__paragraph-p">Muramvya is one of the 18 provinces of Burundi. In the kingdom era, Muramvya was the royal capital and in 2007, because of its cultural and natural landscape, it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. It is located
                        in the center of Burundi, between the two capitals (economic and political).</p>
                    <p class="places__paragraph-p">The weather is rather chilly at night, but during the day, you would think you're in heaven. At 2,665 meters (8,743 ft) above sea level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest places in the province. But that cool breeze allows for one of
                        the largest plantations of tea and coffee in the country, which make up the bulk of Burundi's exports.</p>
                    <p class="places__paragraph-p">The Kibira National Park, one of the largest wildlife reserves for apes, overlaps four provinces, including Muramvya. This National Park lies at the apex of the beautiful mountains of the Congo-Nile Divide, ranging between 1,550 and
                        2,660 meters of altitude. It is filled with beautiful vegetation, and a source for the various rivers and streams which provide water around the country.</p>

                    <p class="places__paragraph-p">Ness Ziona is located on the Israeli coastal plain approximately 10 km (6 mi) inland of the Mediterranean Sea, to the south of Tel Aviv. The city is bordered to the north by Rishon LeZion, to the east by Be'er Ya'akov, and to the south
                        by Rehovot. Beit Hanan, Beit Oved, Ayanot youth village and Kibbutz Netzer Sereni also border the city. The city has been designed to have a rural character due to urban planning that bans the construction of buildings higher than
                        eight stories. Property values have risen by 30 percent in recent years.[</p>
                    <p class="places__paragraph-p">Ness Ziona is home to the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR), a secret government defence research institute working in chemical and biological research[18] with 350 employees, and Zenith Solar, a solar energy company.[19]
                        The Kiryat Weizmann Science Park is a magnet for many Israeli start-ups, among them Indigo Digital Press, which was acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2002 and manufactures high-end digital printing presses.</p>
